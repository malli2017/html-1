<h3>triggers</h3>
<p>A PL/SQL program unit associated with a particular database table is called a database trigger. It is used for :
Audit data modifications.
Log events transparently.
Enforce complex business rules.
Maintain replica tables
Derive column values
Implement Complex security authorizations</p>

<h3>stored Procedure</h3>
<p>A stored procedure is a sequence of statement or a named PL/SQL block which performs one or more specific functions.
 It is similar to a procedure in other programming languages. It is stored in the database and can be repeatedly executed. 
 It is stored as schema object. It can be nested, invoked and parameterized.

<h3>cursor and why it is required</h3>
<p>A cursor is a temporary work area created in a system memory when an SQL statement is executed.
A cursor contains information on a select statement and the row of data accessed by it. 
This temporary work area stores the data retrieved from the database and manipulate this data.
 A cursor can hold more than one row, but can process only one row at a time. Cursor are required to process rows individually for queries.</p>
 
 <a name="join"><h3>joins</h3></a>
 <p>A SQL join is a Structured Query Language (SQL) instruction to combine data from two 
 sets of data (e.g. two tables). Before we dive into the details of a SQL join, let’s briefly
 discuss what SQL is, and why someone would want to perform a SQL join.

SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing information 
in a relational database management system (RDBMS). The word relational here is key; it specifies that the 
database management system is organized in such a way
 that there are clear relations defined between different sets of data. </p>
 
 <table border="1" width=100% cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
        <tr>
		<th>type</th>
		<th>des</th>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
		<td>left</td>
		<td>Select all records from Table A and Table B, where the join condition is met</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>outer</td>
		<td>Select all records from Table A, along with records from Table B for which the join condition is met (if at all)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>right</td>
		<td>Select all records from Table B, along with records from Table A for which the join condition is met (if at all)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		
		<td>inner</td>
		<td>Select all records from Table A and Table B, regardless of whether the join condition is met or not.</td>
		</tr>

 <p> How is a process of PL/SQL compiled?
Compilation process includes syntax check, bind and p-code generation processes.
Syntax checking checks the PL/SQL codes for compilation errors.
 When all errors are corrected, a storage address is assigned to the variables that hold data.
 It is called Binding. P-code is a list of instructions for the PL/SQL engine. 
 P-code is stored in the database for named blocks and is used the next time it is executed.
Go through this tutorial to learn more about handling PL/SQL errors.

6. Mention what PL/SQL package consists of?
A PL/SQL package consists of
PL/SQL table and record TYPE statements
Procedures and Functions
Cursors
Variables ( tables, scalars, records, etc.) and constants
Exception names and pragmas for relating an error number with an exception
Cursors

7. What are the benefits of PL/SQL packages?
It provides several benefits like
Enforced Information Hiding: It offers the liberty to choose whether to keep data private or public
Top-down design: You can design the interface to the code hidden in the package before you actually implemented the modules themselves
Object persistence: Objects declared in a package specification behaves like a global data for all PL/SQL objects in the application.
 You can modify the package in one module and then reference those changes to another module
Object oriented design: The package gives developers strong hold over how the modules and data structures inside the package can be used
Guaranteeing transaction integrity: It provides a level of transaction integrity
Performance improvement: The RDBMS automatically tracks the validity of all program objects stored
 in the database and enhance the performance of packages.
8. What are different methods to trace the PL/SQL code?
Tracing code is a crucial technique to measure the code performance during the runtime. Different methods for tracing includes
DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO
DBMS_TRACE
DBMS_SESSION and DBMS_MONITOR
trcsess and tkproof utilities
9. What is the difference between FUNCTION, PROCEDURE AND PACKAGE in PL/SQL?
Function: The main purpose of a PL/SQL function is generally to compute and return a single value.
 A function has a return type in its specification and must return a value specified in that type.
Procedure: A procedure does not have a return type and should not return any value but it can have a return 
statement that simply stops its execution and returns to the caller. A procedure is used to return multiple values 
otherwise it is generally similar to a function.
Package: A package is schema object which groups logically related PL/SQL types , items and subprograms. 
You can also say that it is a group of functions, procedure, variables and record type statement.
 It provides modularity, due to this facility it aids application development. It is used to hide information from unauthorized users.
